## Tech Stack

- OpenAI API for embeddings and intelligence
- Qdrant *(running locally)* for storage and search 

## Supported OS

- Tested with Ubuntu 24.04

## Install Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) *(for running Qdrant container)*
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **>= 3.9** *(core runtime)*
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) *(dependency management)*

## Export OpenAI API key

Run this once, replacing `sk-...` with your actual [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys):

```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will persist the export for the current user, so you don't have to execute it every time.

**NOTE:** Embeddings and queries will incur OpenAI API token costs. Use at your own risk.

## Install Archive Agent

Install **Archive Agent** wherever you choose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shredEngineer/Archive-Agent
cd Archive-Agent
poetry install
chmod +x *.sh
echo "alias archive-agent='$(pwd)/archive-agent.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This creates a global `archive-agent` command via shell script.

---

## Setup Qdrant

**IMPORTANT:** To manage Docker without root, run this once **and reboot**:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then launch Qdrant with persistent storage and auto-restart, downloading the image on the first run:

```bash
./ensure-qdrant.sh
```
