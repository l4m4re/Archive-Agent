# üß† Archive Agent

**Smart Indexer with [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) Engine**

- OpenAI API for embeddings and queries
- Qdrant *(running locally)* for storage and search 

![Archive Agent Logo](archive_agent/assets/Archive-Agent-400x300.png)

**Archive Agent** tracks your files, syncs changes, and powers smart queries.  

- Supports command-line interface (CLI) using *Typer*
- Supports graphical user interface (GUI) using *Streamlit*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) *(for running Qdrant server)*
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **>= 3.10** *(core runtime)*
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) *(dependency management)*


- **Tested with Ubuntu 24.04**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Export OpenAI API key

To export your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), replace `sk-...` with your actual key and run this once:

```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will persist the export for the current user.

**NOTE:** Embeddings and queries will incur OpenAI API token costs. **Use at your own risk.**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install Archive Agent

To install **Archive Agent** in the current directory of your choice, run this once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shredEngineer/Archive-Agent
cd Archive-Agent
poetry install
chmod +x *.sh
echo "alias archive-agent='$(pwd)/archive-agent.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will create a global `archive-agent` command for the current user.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Qdrant server

**IMPORTANT:** To manage Docker without root, run this once **and reboot**:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

To launch Qdrant with persistent storage and auto-restart, run this once:

```bash
./ensure-qdrant.sh
```

This will download the Qdrant docker image on the first run.

**NOTE:** In case you need to stop the Qdrant Docker image, run this:

```bash
docker stop archive-agent-qdrant-server
```

---

## üöÄ Run Archive Agent

The default settings profile is created on the first run. (See [Storage](#-storage) section.)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è How files are processed

**Archive Agent** currently supports these file types:
- Text: `.txt`, `.md`
- Image: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`

**Archive Agent** decodes everything to text like this:
- Text files are decoded to UTF-8, regardless of original encoding.
- Image files are decoded to text using OpenAI vision.
  - The vision model will reject unintelligible images.

**NOTE:** Unsupported files are tracked but not processed.

**Archive Agent** processes decoded text like this:
- Each decoded text is split into smaller chunks.
- Each chunk is turned into a vector using OpenAI embeddings.
- Each vector is turned into a *point* with file metadata.
- Each *point* is stored in the Qdrant database.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è How chunks are retrieved

**Archive Agent** retrieves chunks related to your question like this:
- The question is turned into a vector using OpenAI embeddings.
- Points with similar vectors are retrieved from the Qdrant database.
- Chunks of points with sufficient score are returned.

**Archive Agent** answers your question using retrieved chunks like this:
- The LLM receives the retrieved chunks as context to the question.
- The LLM's answer is returned.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è How files are selected for tracking

**Archive Agent** uses *patterns* to select your files:

- Patterns can be actual file paths.
- Patterns can be paths containing wildcards that resolve to actual file paths.
- Patterns must be specified as (or resolve to) *absolute* paths, e.g. `/home/user/Documents/*.txt` (or `~/Documents/*.txt`).
- Patterns may use the wildcard `**` to match any files and zero or more directories, subdirectories, and symbolic links to directories.

There are *included patterns* and *excluded patterns*:

- The set of resolved excluded files is removed from the set of resolved included files.   
- Only the remaining set of files (included but not excluded) is tracked by **Archive Agent**. 

**NOTE:** Hidden files are always ignored.

### ‚ö° List usage info

To show the list of supported commands, run this:

```bash
archive-agent
```

### ‚ö° Add included patterns

To add one or more included patterns, run this:

```bash
archive-agent include "~/Documents/*.txt"
```

**NOTE:** **Always use quotes** to prevent your shell's wildcard expansion.

(Skip the pattern argument to get an interactive prompt.)

### ‚ö° Add excluded patterns

To add one or more excluded patterns, run this:

```bash
archive-agent exclude "~/Documents/*.txt"
```

**NOTE:** **Always use quotes** to prevent your shell's wildcard expansion.

(Skip the pattern argument to get an interactive prompt.)

### ‚ö° Remove included / excluded patterns

To remove one or more previously included / excluded patterns, run this:

```bash
archive-agent remove "~/Documents/*.txt"
```

**NOTE:** **Always use quotes** to prevent your shell's wildcard expansion.

(Skip the pattern argument to get an interactive prompt.)

### ‚ö° List included / excluded patterns

To show the list of included / excluded patterns, run this: 

```bash
archive-agent patterns
```

### ‚ö° Resolve patterns and track files

To resolve all patterns and track changes to your files, run this:

```bash
archive-agent track
```

### ‚ö° List tracked files

To show the full list of tracked files, run this: 

```bash
archive-agent list
```

### ‚ö° List changed files

To show the list of changed files, run this: 

```bash
archive-agent diff
```

### ‚ö° Commit changed files to database

To sync changes to your files with the Qdrant database, run this:

```bash
archive-agent commit
```

**NOTE:** Changes are triggered by:
- File added
- File removed
- File changed:
  - Different file size
  - Different modification date

### ‚ö° Search your files

```bash
archive-agent search "Which files mention donuts?"
```

Lists files matching the question.

(Skip the question argument to get an interactive prompt.)

### ‚ö° Query your files

```bash
archive-agent query "Which files mention donuts?"
```

Answers your question using RAG.

(Skip the question argument to get an interactive prompt.)

### ‚ö° Launch Archive Agent GUI

To launch the **Archive Agent** GUI in your browser, run this:

```bash
archive-agent gui
```

Press `CTRL+C` in the console to close the GUI server.

**NOTE:** The GUI currently supports queries only.
